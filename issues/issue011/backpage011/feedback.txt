I have cerebral palsy which means that my movements are not very
accurate!!  So using a soldering iron is not possible. It also makes
using windows difficult. I use Linux for that reason.  So I love the
Raspberry Pi. Only problem is when I try to get add-ons for it. It is
not always clear from the advertisement whether the add-on comes
soldered together or not. Indeed  on a couple of occasions the picture
was of the assembled part but when I ordered it the part that arrived
was needed soldering rendering it useless for me!! Could I please use
the pages of your magazine to plead with suppliers to make clear whether
their parts need soldering or not?
